# Advent of Code 2022 Using C
Advent of Code: https://adventofcode.com/

In my spare time whenever I'm not working on my [moca](https://github.com/Kiyoshika/moca) compiler, I will probably chip away at the Advent of Code problems, but likely will not do all of them.

Each problem will have a dedicated folder with the problem statement and general approach along with a simple makefile to build the executable.
